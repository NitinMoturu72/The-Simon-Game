# Simon_Game
Simon is a classic memory game where players must remember and repeat a sequence of colors.
As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more challenging. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery) to create a web-based version of the Simon game.

Description
Simon is an engaging and challenging memory game that tests players' ability to remember and reproduce sequences of colors. Each level presents an additional color to the sequence, increasing the difficulty as players advance. This implementation is designed with a retro look using the "Press Start 2P" font and includes sound effects for a complete gaming experience.
